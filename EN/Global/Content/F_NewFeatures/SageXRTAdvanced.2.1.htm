            <p>Several calendars are required when those days vary according to the bank branches.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>creating the calendars</li>
                <li>linking them to branches</li>

            <ul>
                <li>the account statement must include an opening and a closing balance</li>
                <li>for each account statement, the opening balance received should be equal to the amount of the last closing balance imported</li>
