        <p>The remittance constitution process is the same as for all orders, whatever their types. Domestic, commercial and even treasury transfers can be processed at the same time.</p>
        <p>However the orders to validate are the only ones to have access to the remittance process.</p>
        <p>In the application, an order that must be remitted may be grouped with other orders. All the orders belonging to a same batch are processed to be stored in a remittance file that complies with the relevant bank format.</p>
