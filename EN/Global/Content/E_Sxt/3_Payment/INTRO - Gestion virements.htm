        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXT_Payment" style="font-weight: bold;" /> module is integrated into the <MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXT" style="font-weight: bold;" /> ERP software<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">, you can view its flowchart presented below</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/L_Payment/Sage-XRT-Treasury.png" class="SAGE_screenshot" /></p>
        <p>This module is designed to meet your needs in terms of payment order management, and particularly treasury transfers, in a fully secure environment.</p>
        <p class="SautLigne">Its modularity enables interfaces between the systems - and hence data exchange -, the dematerialization of flows, the enhanced rapidity and security of your banking exchange. All these possibilities will generate a substantial gain for you company, in terms of performance and productivity.</p>
        <p class="SautLigne">Fully integrated to the <MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXT" style="font-weight: bold;" /> suite, <MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXT_Payment" style="font-weight: bold;" /> is in constant communication with the <MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXT_Cash" style="font-weight: bold;" />, <MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXSign" style="font-weight: bold;" /> and <MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXComm" style="font-weight: bold;" /> modules to ensure a real-time update of flows. <MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXComm" style="font-weight: bold;" /> can then take over from the <MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXT_Payment" style="font-weight: bold;" /> module to directly transmit the transfer orders to their beneficiaries.<br />If one of your banks uses the EBICS standard, your files can be encrypted by the <MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXSign" style="font-weight: bold;" /> application.</p>
        <p class="SautLigne">To facilitate your usage of <b>Payment</b>, we decided to always use the same working logic, whatever the transaction type.</p>
        <p class="SautLigne">You will always find the following operating principles:</p>
        <p class="SautLigne">
            <ul>
                <li class="PuceNiv1">Every payment whose type - International, Commercial, Domestic or SEPA Transfers - is not recognized, is identified by the module as a <b>payment request</b> that cannot be fully processed until it is completed.</li>
                <li class="PuceNiv1">Each payment order is associated with a status which represents its place in the remittance process. This status goes from&quot; To Complete&quot;, &quot;To Validate&quot; or &quot;To Authorize&quot; to &quot;Validated&quot; or &quot;Authorized&quot; when the payment order is ready to be remitted to the bank.</li>
                <li class="PuceNiv1"><i>Profiles</i> must be set up to associate technical characteristics of the remittance file generation (bank format, protocol, etc.) with each transaction type.</li>
                <li class="PuceNiv1"><i>Constitution Rules</i> must also be created to define, for each transaction type, the way the order remittances will be constituted (multi-currency, multi-date, etc.).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="SautLigne" MadCap:conditions="">On top of these basic principles, there are some other functions that are common to the various transaction types, such as the selection of the orders to be processed (selection by status, by applicant, by beneficiary, etc.), the type of data to enter, the potential re-use of the order characteristics through the saving of <i>Templates</i>, the import of Payment Orders and Requests, and the generation of Documents.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="" class="SautLigne">Eventually, as <MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXT_Payment" style="font-weight: bold;" /> is integrated into the <MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXT" style="font-weight: bold;" /> application suite, some of the setup must be defined from the <b>Setup</b>, <b>Common Administration</b> and <b>Market Data</b> modules, which are common to every application of the range.</p>
