        <h1 class="LegacySXT">Entering and Modifying Invoices</h1>
        <p class="SAGE_BodyText"><MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXT_Netting" style="font-weight: bold;" /> provides you with functions that secure and facilitate the entry of invoices: input must be authorized in the user profile.</p>
        <p class="SAGE_BodyText">Invoices are usually entered for a defined cycle, but some of them may be transferred to a later cycle and date.</p>
        <p class="SAGE_BodyText">The center can contact participants to make them validate the entered invoices. If modifications are needed, they can be easily integrated.</p>
        <p class="SAGE_BodyText">Even when invoices are validated, they can be cancelled, for events such as the return of invoiced goods. In this case, the module generates interco. credit notes which are then integrated into the netting process.</p>
        <p class="SAGE_BodyText"><MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXT_Netting" style="font-weight: bold;" /> also enables you to manage third-party invoices on behalf of participants: the center manages payments for the third parties and integrates the processing into the netting process.</p>
