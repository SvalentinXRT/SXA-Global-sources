        <h1 class="LegacySXT">Core Concepts</h1>
        <p class="SAGE_BodyText"><MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXT_Netting" style="font-weight: bold;" /> is based on three core concepts.</p>

                <p class="SAGE_BodyText">In <MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXT_Netting" style="font-weight: bold;" /> module, the netting process takes place during specific periods of time called <i>cycles</i>.</p>
                <p>You can define cycles and generate them automatically to precisely fit your needs and fully profit from <MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXT_Netting" style="font-weight: bold;" /> functions. You may also set up a flexible calendar for payments.</p>
                <p>Cycles consist of four steps:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                    <li>Centralization</li>
                    <li>Simulation</li>
                    <li>Simulation Approval</li>
                    <li>Validation Process</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="SAGE_BodyText">You can make as many simulations as needed for current and future cycles.</p>
                <p class="SautLigne">These simulations enable you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To calculate the approximate net positions before the end of the invoice notification phase</li>
                    <li>To take into account the potential modifications on the invoices (approval phase)</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="SautLigne">The netting process involves two types of conversion:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="PuceNiv1">First, invoices amounts expressed in the invoicing currency, are converted into the netting currency.</li>
                    <li class="PuceNiv1">Then, the net result expressed in the netting currency is converted into the payment currency.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="SautLigne">Two separate exchange rates are used: one for the calculation of all the amounts to be paid or collected, in the netting currency balance and the other for the payment calculation.</p>
                <p class="SAGE_BodyText">You can choose the rates used to calculate conversions into the netting and payments currencies. The Budget or Market Rates (Average or Buy/Sell) set up in the <b class="SAGE_Bold">Market</b> module, as well as customized rates may be used.</p>
                <p class="SAGE_BodyText">If necessary you may implement markups to pay the center for the completed netting process or to adjust discrepancies between the foreign currencies rates (difference between foreign currencies buy/sell).</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Third Party</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p class="SAGE_BodyText">One of the most interesting functions lays in the potential integration of third parties into the netting process. Through the module and the netting center, third parties may pay their invoices to participants.</p>
                <p class="SAGE_BodyText">The netting center then becomes the core of all the activities of third parties: it both collects payments from third parties, and settles payments to them. It may as well include all third parties transactions into the netting process on behalf of the participants.</p>
                <p class="SAGE_BodyText">From third parties&apos; point of view, no conversion occurs as the invoicing and payment currencies are the same: the module provides you with a centralization system for payments.</p>
