        <p><b>Origin of the Exchange Risk</b></p>
        <p class="SautLigneAvantEtAprès">When companies close deals into different currencies, they face exchange risk. The risk is due to the fluctuations of currencies between each other.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="PuceNiv1">If a company buys and sells into different currencies, then its turnover and expenses can vary according to the fluctuations of the exchange rate for these currencies.</li>
            <li class="PuceNiv1">If a Company has borrowed funds in a different currency, the repayments of the debt could change or, if the Company has invested overseas, the returns on investment may alter with exchange rate variations — this is usually known as foreign currency exposure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="SautLigne">From the very moment a company acquires assets or performs financial transactions beyond the boundaries of its own country, it faces exchange risk if its commercial position is not hedged: the risk of losses because of a unfavorable variation of the exchange rates, can be hedged with currency futures.</p>
        <p class="SautLigne">The company&apos;s position depends on the difference between:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="PuceNiv1">its commercial forecasts (export and import),</li>
            <li class="PuceNiv1">its currency exchange transactions (buy and sell).</li>
        </ul>
