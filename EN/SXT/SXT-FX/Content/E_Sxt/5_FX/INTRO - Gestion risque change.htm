        <h1 class="LegacySXT">Management of the Exchange Risk</h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXT_FX" style="font-weight: bold;" /> module is integrated into <MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXT" style="font-weight: bold;" /> ERP software.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/L_FX/Sage-XRT-Treasury.png" class="SAGE_screenshot" /></p>
        <p>This module is designed to meet your requirements for the <b>management of FX Transactions and the exchange risk</b>.</p>
        <p>It identifies, measures and covers the exchange risk of your company, using various financial tools: spot exchange, forward exchange, swaps, loans and borrowings. All these possibilities will generate a substantial gain for you company, in terms of performance and productivity.</p>
        <p class="SautLigne">Fully integrated to the <MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXT" style="font-weight: bold;" /> suite,  <MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXT_FX" style="font-weight: bold;" /> is in constant communication with <MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXT_Cash" style="font-weight: bold;" /> to ensure a real-time update of flows. Its logic is a transactional logic. Each transaction is wholly managed from four main points of view:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li class="PuceNiv1">the administrative processing,</li>
            <li class="PuceNiv1">the generation of cash flows,</li>
            <li class="PuceNiv1">the generation of the risk,</li>
            <li class="PuceNiv1">the performance linked to the risk generation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="SautLigne">This transactional approach opens new perspectives, particularly concerning the administration and accounting management — for instance, in the <i>back-office</i> processings.</p>
        <p class="SautLigne">This module is adapted to all the companies that regularly process forward exchange transactions and/or that face an exchange risk: transactions management in forecast mode, foreign or local currency accounts, directions of the various entries.</p>
        <p>This complete and competitive tool is based on three main management areas and covers the fields defined above:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li class="PuceNiv1">the administrative management and processing of FX Transactions, for instance the entry of transactions, the edition of dealing tickets, confirmation letters, and payment orders,</li>
            <li class="PuceNiv1">the management of exchange positions (including the commercial positions) and the performance measurement of the risk management, for instance the calculation of the consolidated result on open position,</li>
            <li class="PuceNiv1">the management of cash flows linked to these transactions and the monitoring of currency accounts, as well as the update based on the exchange positions, the actual payments specified on the statements of bank accounts.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="SautLigne">This module also enables you to manage the exchange risk incurred by Loan and Borrowing Transactions in the position worksheet and in the Currency Loans/Borrowings Ledger.</p>
        <p class="SautLigne">However, the creations, updates and deletions for Currency Borrowing and Loan Transactions take place in <MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXT_FinTrans" style="font-weight: bold;" />. For more information on these functions, see the module documentation.</p>
