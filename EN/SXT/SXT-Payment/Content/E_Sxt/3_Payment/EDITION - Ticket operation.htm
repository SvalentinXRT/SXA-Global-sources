        <p>This document recaps all the charcateristics of the payment, as they appear in the dialog box where details are entered and viewed.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/L_Payment/Ticket d'operation.png" class="SAGE_screenshot" /></p>
        <p>So, if you edit the dealing ticket from the payment list, it only includes the minimum of details, whether the payment is complete or not.</p>
        <p class="SautLigne">On the contrary, if you edit the dealing ticket from the Transfers list, it includes all the fields. Depending on the order status, these fields are completed or blank.</p>
        <p>Whatever the access to payments, the <b>Ticket</b> command in the contextual menu generates the document in the <b>Reporting</b> module.</p>
