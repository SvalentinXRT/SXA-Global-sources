                <p>The solution uses industry-proved crypto-algorithms: AES256 (AES with 256-bit key), HMASCHA512, HMASCHA256, PBKDF2, MS DPAPI.</p>
                <p>Every document is encrypted with AES256 and signed with HMACSHA512.</p>
                <p>Every document is encrypted with a unique session key which is derived with HMACSHA256 function from the common master key. It means the knowledge of the key used for encryption of a particular document gives no possibility to decrypt any other document.</p>
                <p>Encryption/decryption is performed on the platform level and is totally transparent.</p>

                <p>The master key (256 bits) is generated by the administrator based on the password provided by PBKDF2 function.</p>
                <p>The master key is versioned and can be replaced by a new one (on a regular basis or, for eg., when the administrator has left company).</p>
                <p>During the key change process, the current master key is encrypted with the new one and stored in the database. All the documents encrypted with previous key versions, are therefore still available for users, whereas all new documents will be encrypted with the new key.</p>

                <p>The actual master key is not stored in the database. The decryption of the stored documents is impossible, even in case of server theft.</p>
                <p>Master key is stored on the IIS server computer encrypted with MS Data Protection API (special cryptographic engine developed by Microsoft for AES256, HMACSHA512 and PBKDF2 algorithms) for a virtual account of IIS Application Pool identity.</p>
                <p>The master key could only be compromised if a hacker had physical access to the IIS server machine or had an authorized account on it (which would be common to all security systems with internal keys storage).</p>

                <p>Keys can be managed by the administrator through the solution UI with the ADMINISTRATOR account. Administration rights for IIS or the database server are not required.<br />This tool enables the administrator:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                    <li>To create another master key based on the password provided during the installation of <MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXA_BankDelegations" style="font-weight: bold;" /> application. A password policy check is performed on new passwords. Rules for this policy are set in <MadCap:variable name="Localization.SXA_BankDelegations" style="font-weight: bold;" /> configuration file.</li>
                    <li>To replace the current key by a new one; in this case, the password used to generate the previous key, must be specified too.</li>
                    <li>To create a key on a new server corresponding to the last key used in the application if the application has been moved to another server. The password used to generate the current key, must be specified.</li>
