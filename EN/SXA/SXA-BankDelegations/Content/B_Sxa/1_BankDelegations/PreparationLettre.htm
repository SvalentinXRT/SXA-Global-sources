        <h1 class="HelpTopics">Preparing Letter Contents</h1>
        <p>Letter Generation is based on Unit Delegations. Generation Rules are used for the letter content preparation. Contents are displayed as they will in final letters through the use of Letter Templates.</p>
        <p>By default, letters are generated by branch and by company. But you can also generate letters by account and by transaction type.</p>
        <p>The delegations generated through a template may build up letters. Letters can also be built up based on the fusion of delegations generated through several templates.</p>
        <p>Letter Management process goes through various statuses: <b class="SAGE_Bold">Draft</b>, <b class="SAGE_Bold">Sent</b>, <b class="SAGE_Bold">Archived</b> and <b class="SAGE_Bold">Lapsed</b>.</p>
